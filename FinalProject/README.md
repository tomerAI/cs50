# ML-model of Spaceship Titanic
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/kR9Akbpfk7E>
#### Description:
In this project i created a ML-model in the spaceship.py file that is trained to predict
if a passenger aboard the spaceship titanic is transported to an alternate dimension or not.
After training the model it is saved as 'gb-model.pkl' and is used by my 'app.py' to let users predict 
if a customizable passenger would survive the spaceship titanic. 
The user can customize their passenger through a webpage and see the prediction and a history of predictions.
